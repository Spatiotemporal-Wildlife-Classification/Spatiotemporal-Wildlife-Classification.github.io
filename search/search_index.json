However, due to the harsh environments, variable image quality, and long-tail data distribution, traditional  wildlife classification methods struggle to achieve top performance. </p> <p>Existing studies have successfully used metadata to boost the performance of image classification.  Additionally, the taxonomic structure of metadata falls into the cascading classifier domain.  The findings of previous studies, lead to the investigation of how taxonomic levels influence the performance  of metadata and image classification models. Further, how can the determined trends be leveraged within a novel  cascading ensemble classifier utilizing both metadata and image classification components to improve upon traditional  methods.</p> <p>The proposed research questions include:</p> <ol> <li>How does taxonomic level influence the performance of metadata classification?</li> <li>How does taxonomic level influence the performance of image classification?</li> <li>How does the novel cascading ensemble method improve upon baseline classifiers?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#distributed-scraping-network","title":"Distributed Scraping Network","text":"<p>This API is created to run on a server, providing a central means of distributing and collecting weather data from Open-Meteo.  This server provides a means of accessing and running a DSN leaf node at any computer.  This allows collection to occur externally running from a form of cloud computing.  This allows you to keep your computer free to work on other topics while data collection occurs.</p> <p>This API is run in combination with results obtained from Spatiotemporal Wildlife Classification and DSN Leaf.</p>"},{"location":"#dsn-leaf","title":"DSN Leaf","text":"<p>This repository serves to provide a leaf node within the Distributed Scraping Network (DSN).  The DSN provides a central point of communication for the leaf node through the use of a FastAPI. The leaf node communicates with the central DSN to determine essential wildlife observation details,  required to make a weather data request to the Open-Meteo historical API. Once the data is retrieved, the leaf node formats the collected data, and posts it back to the central DSN for collection and storage. </p> <p>In summary, the leaf node collects the weather/ metadata for each observation and transfers it to a central storage.  This enables the creation of the Spatiotemporal Wildlife Classification's novel dataset, specifically the metadata values.</p>"},{"location":"#animal-detector","title":"Animal Detector","text":""},{"location":"#binary-image-labelling","title":"Binary Image Labelling","text":""},{"location":"#favourites-gallery","title":"Favourites Gallery","text":""}]}
